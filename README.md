Amazon SP-API no longer requires AWS IAM and Signature Version 4! ðŸ¤¯

For developers who've tried the Amazon SP-API, the most challenging part was AWS setup and sending requests with Signatures. This is no longer the case.

Now everyone can easily do sample requests using any programming language. ðŸ¤“

I have just recorded a quick YouTube tutorial, where I am talking about the change and showing how to do a simple request and retrieve orders using Python.
